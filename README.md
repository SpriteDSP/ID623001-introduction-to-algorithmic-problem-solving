ChatGPT usage:

I used ChatGPT occasionally as my helping hand to help me understand concepts, I'd present prompts such as "please explain how this method works with comments and summary...".

If I was really in trouble and had a hard time getting started with a certain task, I would ask ChatGPT to tell me what function should I be using or ask it to generate an example for me to look at

For the first 2 games I used ChatGPT when I was rarely stuck, however for the 3rd game I utilized it often to explain ideas further in detail as I found the 3rd game very complex compared to the others.
